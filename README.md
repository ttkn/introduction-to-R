This repository contains several R scripts that perform simple operations on a few small datasets. They were assigned in the Introduction to R course offered by Johns Hopkins University at Coursera.

Three of the scripts, pollutantmean.R, complete.R, and corr.R, are based on 332 csv files that contain pollution monitoring data from 332 sites across the United States. The first, pollutantmean.R, practices reading and working with a large number of files in R.
