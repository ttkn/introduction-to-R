(Download here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog%2Fdata%2Fspecdata.zip) They practice reading in a large number of files, combining them, and performing operations on the result.

The other three, best.R, rankhospital.R, and rankall.R, use a csv containing various measures of performance for hospitals throughout the United States. (Download here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog%2Fdata%2FProgAssignment3-data.zip) They constitute an exercise in subsetting and grouping data, sorting the results, and returning results by using indexing.
